From what I learned, Chen Hui Jing is very passionate about CSS and learning it. I admire that about her because not a lot of people that I know of from my classes are very interested with CSS. She learned alot of CSS by owning an RSS reader up until now, she'd subscribed to lots of web development articles, read books, did online courses repeatedly. I read in one of her interviews how helpful it was to do online courses over and over again because it helps solidify the idea in your mind and I completely agree with that.

Chen Hui Jing is also a member of CSSWG which is a working group created by the World Wide Web Consortium in 1997. This group of people are the ones who tackles the issues of CSS that has not been addressed before. When I also read an article about her work there and as a CSS teacher, it was very interesting to me how she said something along the lines of '*`... being less knowledgeable about web development can bring in more ideas and a broader perspective...`*' At first, I was very confused as to why she said that but it made more sense
