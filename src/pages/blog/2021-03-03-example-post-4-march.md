We are a Dunedin-based second-hand online store which aims to inspire the wider local community and flatting students who come from different parts of New Zealand to live and think more sustainably.

“Name of shop” is more than just a second-hand online store, we are a community that aims to do our part to help create a sustainable environment.

# **Did you know?**

The fashion industry is the second largest polluter in the world. While clothing takes up so much energy, water and other resources to create, these also cause tons of harmful waste. Not only that, clothing that ends up in landfill can take years to decompose.

Do you ever wonder how and why new, trendy, popular shopping websites sell such cheap clothing, shoes and accessories? Well it’s most likely because they are fast-fashion brands which tackles the issue of child labour in the poorest parts of the world. And this is also why the make of some pieces you may receive is poorly made and easy to break – because children work to create those when they shouldn’t be.

# **How do we help?** 

Well, we accept any pre-loved items such as clothing, utensils, excess fabric, electronics, you name it, and we do our best to repair, clean and make the things you bring into something that can be usable again. 

# **Our team**

We have a team of amazing creative people who can teach you and me how to sew, mend, paint and clean these items – we can learn for free! Or are you interested in fashion? Would you be willing to use your magic to help us turn these old fabrics into beautiful pieces of clothing? If so, come and join our community!

Not only do we believe in selling old usable clothes, we also believe in creatively learning new ways to reinvent them and turn them into something new and usable.
