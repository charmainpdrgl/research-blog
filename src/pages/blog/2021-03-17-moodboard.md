I have initially only had a couple of images which I got from Pinterest, the typefaces at the left side as well as the color palette consisting of 6 colors below the typefaces. This moodboard expanded into what it is now because I decided to create a palette derived from each of the photos itself. I wanted to see which colors were common among the photos. Then, I screenshotted the main page of existing online thrift websites and identified their own color palettes.

I chose colors that are kind of muted because I would like it to be more of a vintage-y vibe. Also because I think there's already lots of thrift stores that are very colorful and has more of a 90's vibe to it such as the websites I screenshotted at the right-hand side. But I didn't want it to look too vintage-y or too dark so a pop of light blue and / or yellow would make it look better.

The typefaces I have above aren't the final ones yet but I would really like to keep the fourth typeface. I think I would use this for quotes or little aside notes -- not as a title or body text because I think it would be too much to look at.
