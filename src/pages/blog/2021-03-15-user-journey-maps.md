I created user journey maps for each of my users - selling a product, buying a product and looking at blogs to learn and book a workshop. The user journey maps include phases, actions, emotions, pain points and insights / oppurtunities that the user might potentially experience.

This user journey map above is about going into the tutorial blog section and booking a spot for an upcoming workshop. I should add that the solution for the user not being able to attend a workshop is reading the tutorial blog. The tutorial blog should be detailed enough so that the user can follow through and be able to do tutorials easily. These tutorial blogs could include videos, images, etc.

The user journey map above is for the seller of a product. At the moment, I haven't identified any pain points and solutions if there's any.

![Buying a Product](/img/img_0898.png "Buying a Product")

This last user journey map is for the buyer of a product.
