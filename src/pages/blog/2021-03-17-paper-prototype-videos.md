These are the videos of the paper prototype I've done for each of my user stories. The feedback for the first prototype was helpful because at first I wanted the user to log in or register first before they could view the items - but the suggestion was to have the user tap on an item first before triggering a pop-up box for them to log in or register. I really liked this idea because some people really just want to know what the app offers first before actually creating an account and becoming a member.

The second one already assumes that the user had already logged in - since we already saw that on the first prototype. Just a small note, for the second screen on this video, the user should've tapped next after choosing photos and going onto the next screen.

For the third video, it's quite short because I haven't completely finished the prototype (might have to redo it). I'm not completely happy with the layout of this screen - I think it could improve with a bit more thought into it but I'm still not sure how to lay it out properly. But it's a start.
