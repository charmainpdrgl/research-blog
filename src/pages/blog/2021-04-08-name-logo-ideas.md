It took me a while to choose a name for my website but I eventually thought of one and it's called REthrift. I got the RE from reuse, reduce, recycle and it signifies repeating something. Then I just added thrift at the end so that when people hear the name they would automatically know that it is a thrifting / second-hand website.

I came up with a few logos. 

![rethrift](/img/rethrift.png "Logo 1")

![rethrift](/img/rethrift2.png "Logo 2")

![rethrift](/img/logo3.png "Logo 3")



I really liked the first one but it just looks too basic when it's up on the navbar so I didn't end up using it.

The second one, I like the idea of it looking like a bag but the font wasn't good - it didn't look readable when it was up in the navbar so I didn't use that one.

The third one - ignore the white box - but I chose this one because it looks readable, doesn't look too squished on the navbar and the color just pops.
