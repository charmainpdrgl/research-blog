I chose these font style because I want my user to be able to read through my website clearly. The I chose Spectral as my heading and subheading - with different font weights of course, because I think it looks more eyecatching compared to the body text I chose which is called Karla. For my heading I'm still deciding wether or not to have it all capitalized or not. I chose Karla as my body text because it looks very simple and neat - I don't want my website to look crazy by using wild fonts that my users can't read properly.

My colour palette has is more of a muted feel to it but still keeping in mind the contrast. For my background color, I would use the top right shade (#f5f2df) so that the website would look very welcoming otherwise if I use the darker color as the background, it would feel too dark. Then I would use either of the dark browns on the left side (#473d3f, #402e2a) so that the users would be able to see the text in contrast with the lighter background.

For the remaining colors, I would just use it here and there for buttons, banners or a section of the website.
